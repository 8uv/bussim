          The Bus Simulator Wiki has been moved over 2 Times already, the first two being on Fandom,
          and this one being hosted/maintianed by Nyx (@nyxical).

          Editing on this wiki is currently way too complicated for inexperienced users. Although I'm still finding a way to make it alot easier.. right now we have YAML as a way to store information on this wiki. - Nyx

          Bus Simulator is a game that was created in 2018 on ROBLOX, and was made as a small little socialization project at first, 
          but kept getting more updates from there, taking on many expansive updates that immerse you in the comedic world of events on a bus that is forever waiting for its real stop,
          unsure if you will actually reach it.

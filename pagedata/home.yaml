  ##[Info]
  Bus Simulator is a game that was created in 2018 on ROBLOX, and was made as a small little socialization project at first, 
  but kept getting more updates from there, taking on many expansive updates that immerse you in the comedic world of events on a bus that is forever waiting for its real stop,
  unsure if you will actually reach it.

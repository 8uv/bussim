         Cubes is an event that, 
         like other events, 
         has a chance of happening every 5 minutes.

         <br><br>

         During the event Cubes, 
         cubes move all around the bus, 
         playing many xylophone notes. 
         After some time, 
         the driver announces they've convinced the cubes to go back to Nintendo Land. 
         A few moments after that, 
         the event ends.

      content:
        - name: This event is an obvious reference to the Nintendo GameCube startup sequence.
        - name: Perhaps another, unintentional reference, the "Nintendo Land" that the cubes return to is the same name as a Wii U launch title.
        - name: Sometimes a cube can make a sound that goes "Boom! Fricko!"
          children:
            - name: It comes from the game <a href='https://www.roblox.com/games/2081092459/Boom-and-Fricko'>Boom and Fricko</a>.
        - name: The runtime of this event is 1 minute and 5 seconds, making it a really similar runtime to both the <a href='/bussim/events/bacon-hair'>Bacon Hair</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/glitches'>Glitches</a> events.

          The Gandalf event is a reference to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lord_of_the_Rings_(film_series)">The Lord of the Rings</a>, 
          where Gandalf stops the bus while yelling "YOU SHALL NOT PASS!"

          <br><br>

          This lasts for quite a while eventually causing the driver to become impatient. 
          Eventually Gandalf disappears and the Bus continues its journey as usual.

          <i>Are you looking for the <a href='/bussim/events/fake-events'>fake version</a> of this event, perhaps?</i>

          <br><br>

          The No Gas event, 
          or internally known as Gas Up, 
          is the true version of the Fake No Gas, 
          where instead of the bus driver fooling their passengers again, 
          the bus actually runs out of gas and the players will have to collect 6 gas cans near the road.

          <br><br>

          While an event such as this may be harmless, 
          it can be obstructed by generating terrain, 
          spawn in the skies, 
          or happen during a biome unsuitable for such event. 
          <small>(Examples being, <a href='/bussim/biomes/overseas'>Overseas</a> & <a href='/bussim/biomes/lava'>Lava</a>)</small> Which can make getting the gas cans harder, 
          if not inaccessible without proper equipment like <a href='/bussim/items/helicopter'>Helicopter</a>, 
          <a href='/bussim/items/gas-station-gravity-coil'>Gas Station Gravity Coil</a>, 
          <a href='/bussim/items/hoverboots'>Hoverboots</a>, 
          and others.

          <br><br>

          Eventually though after 5 minutes, 
          to prevent soft-locking; 
          the event will forcibly end regardless if the requirements are met as to not make the event permanent.

        - name: When it comes to determining a <a href='/bussim/events/fake-events'>Fake No Gas</a> compared to the real one, it is easy to tell based on the different dialogue, since this event contains multiple dialogue, whilst the fake event has only one.
        - name: The added difficulty when it comes to this occurring in unsuitable biomes are mainly unintentional, for it was an old event and it is rare for such conditions to happen.

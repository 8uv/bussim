          The Fake Bus Stop event is an event where the bus driver distracts players by acting like they made it to the bus stop, 
          and then drives off, 
          making players respawn on the bus. 
          The event has a similar appearance to the <a href='/bussim/events/passengers'>Passengers</a> event, 
          where it also stops at a bus stop, 
          but it has no passengers waiting for the bus.

        - name: The event runtime is only 15 seconds, making it the shortest event in the game (if you don't include the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a> event's 12-second or server shutdown runtime).

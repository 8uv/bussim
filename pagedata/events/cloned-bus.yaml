         The Clone Event is an event in Bus Simulator, 
         where the bus gets cloned. 
         Eventually it turns out it's unstable and disappears shortly after.

         <br><br>

         In the cloned bus you may find everything from the normal bus, 
         but the driver seat isn't working properly, 
         the next stop and eyes are different, 
         and some features aren't usable.

        - name: The cloned bus may be quite hard to get to if it happens in a tunnel, as you are likely to bump your head and fall, and while a bit unnecessary, you can use <a href='/bussim/items/hoverboots'>Hoverboots</a> or <a href='/bussim/items/helicopter'>Helicopter</a> to get there, or simply waiting for the bus to leave the tunnel.
        - name: This is one of the more earlier events in this game.
        - name: Despite the name suggesting it being a clone, it doesn't clone any modifications to the Bus like <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>Seasonal Changes</a> nor <a href='/bussim/items/edit'>Edits</a>.
        - name: The runtime for this event is 1 minute and 25 seconds, similar to the <a href='/bussim/events/teddy'>MicSpam</a> event.

          The Lava Floor, 
          or commonly known as The Floor is Lava event, 
          is a sudden, 
          yet deadly event in Bus Simulator, 
          where for the remainder of around a minute, 
          stepping on any ground at all whether it'd be furniture, 
          floors, 
          or parts will end up swiftly dealing damage.
          It can be outpaced however by healing items such as <a href='/bussim/items/cola'>Cola</a>, 
          <a href='/bussim/items/homemade-coffee'>Homemade Coffee</a>, 
          and a few others.

          <br><br>

          To avoid taking damage, 
          you have to make sure you don't touch anything on the ground, 
          seats, 
          parts, 
          and the floor will cause you to take damage. 
          This can be easily done by constantly jumping, 
          using <a href='/bussim/items/hoverboots'>Hoverboots</a>, 
          or <a href='/bussim/items/helicopter'>Helicopter</a> to lift yourself afloat or constantly using healing items. 
          You can also ragdoll if you have the gamepass to avoid taking damage.

          <br><br>

          You may also use the <a href='/bussim/items/magic-mirror'>Magic Mirror</a> to teleport to the <a href='/bussim/events/glacier-cave'>Glacier Caves</a> to avoid the event entirely, 
          or be stuck inside of the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a>, 
          as only the main area is where the event is applicable.

        - name: This is one if not the most deadly event in the game, being able to kill passengers and drivers if they are unprepared for such occasion.
        - name: This event might also stir some confusion as it's not only the floor being lava, but technically any parts that deal damage.
        - name: The maximum damage that you can take in this event is 125-150 hp, which is enough to kill someone and leave them with half health, assuming they survive the initial 100.

        - name: If you are standing on parts above 5,000 studs high, you won't be able to take any damage due to the game's Height Immunity. This is also the same level where other structures like <a href='/bussim/events/glacier-cave'>Glacier Cave</a> and the <a href='/bussim/locations/void'>Void (Location)</a> are present, giving their event immunity traits.

          MicSpam is an event in Bus Simulator, 
          where the Bus will forcibly stop to see a rabbit wearing a box in the middle of the lane that the Bus is on. 
          After about one minute, 
          Teddy will begin to sing a song using his <a href='/bussim/items/megaphone'>megaphone</a> and after it has finished, 
          it will promptly drop down a hole, 
          and the event will end. 
          The passengers or driver will then exclaim signs of hearing problems or part of the song's lyrics.

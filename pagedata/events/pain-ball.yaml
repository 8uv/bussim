          The Pain Ball is a short, 
          but very loud event where a ball will be slammed into the windshield, 
          causing screams of pain in the process. 
          Eventually after a while of screaming, 
          the driver finds a way to wipe it off of the windshield, 
          and it succeeds, 
          ending the event.

          The ball is also collidable both inside and outside of the bus, 
          providing a temporary platform.

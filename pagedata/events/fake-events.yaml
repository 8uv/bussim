          The Fake Bus Stop event is an event where the bus driver distracts players by acting like they made it to the bus stop, 
          and then drives off, 
          making players respawn on the bus. 
          The event has a similar appearance to the <a href='/bussim/events/passengers'>Passengers</a> event, 
          where it also stops at a bus stop, 
          but it has no passengers waiting for the bus.

         The Fake No Gas event is an event where the bus stops, 
         and the driver acts like they're out of gas. 
         Shortly afterwards, 
         pranking the passengers once again, 
         acting as a sequel to the Fake Bus Stop event.

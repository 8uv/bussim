          The Space Event is an event in Bus Simulator, 
          where the map is instantly changed to be in space. 
          During this event, 
          all players' gravity will be drastically reduced, 
          with gravity-related items like the <a href='/bussim/items/gas-station-gravity-coil'>Gas Station Gravity Coil</a> being able to make players shoot up into outer space.
          
          <br><br>

          The event ends shortly, setting the gravity back to normal.

          During the event, 
          the bus would stop for a while, 
          while it's stopped the driver would try to figure out what the object is in the sky until sirens go off. 
          After that, 
          the bus start to driver at a quick pace while the nuke strikes. 
          After a few seconds, 
          the driver manages to drive away from the blast, 
          and slow back down to default speed afterwards.

        - name: There was a bug where the Alarm and Theme won't play, this is strange as the music used is uploaded by ROBLOX and the alarm is a sound effect. It's possible that an update broke this event.

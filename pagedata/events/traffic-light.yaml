          The Traffic Light event is a rather simple and straight-forward, 
          when this event is rolled, 
          the bus will stop and waits until the traffic light turns back to green because they are a good driver, 
          disregarding the <a href='/bussim/events/time-travel'>speeding</a>,

          and perhaps other crimes the bus driver has committed prior to this. 
          The event ends after a minute or so.

        - name: Although the bus stops once the traffic light hits red, no other vehicle except the Ice Cream Truck obeys the traffic light.
          children:
            - name: This makes getting ice cream during this event accessible, unless the Ice Cream Truck is either non-existent or has been crashed by another vehicle.
        - name: This can be considered as one of the more basic events in the game that doesn't involve a feature. Other examples are <a href='/bussim/events/mountain'>Mountain</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/nothing'>Nothing</a>.

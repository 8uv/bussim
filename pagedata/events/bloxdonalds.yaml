         The Bloxdonalds is both an Event and a Location in Bus Simulator.

         <br><br>

         When this event happens, 
         the Bus will stop and a random player will mention seeing a Bloxdonalds in the distance. 
         Players are then able to go inside the building and receive a <a href="/bussim/items/burger">Burger</a>. 
         After some time has passed, 
         the driver will mention an oddity within the burgers and afterwards leave, ending the event.

         <br><br>

         During the event, 
         you'll also be able to interact with characters such as: <a href="/bussim/npcs/red">Red</a> and <a href="/bussim/npcs/steven">Steven Scripts</a>. 
         There's also a hidden interactable NPC next to the door, 
         and used to be another NPC in its place but was removed for reasons.

         <br><br>

         Trying to interact with the last NPC says the following:

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: "You : \"...?\""
          children:
            - name: "You : \"The vibes are kinda off in this specific spot... was someone here before..?\""

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: "[Player]: \"Woah! I think I see a Bloxdonalds in the distance!\""
          children:
            - name: "You: \"*gasp*\""
              children:
                - name: After some time has passed...
                  children:
                    - name: "[Player]: \"I'm 99% sure there's something in these burgers.. Evacuate to the bus.\""

      content:
        - name: This is the second largest amount of interactable NPCs, having half as much as <a href="/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">GOATed Gas Station</a>.
        - name: If you use a <a href="/bussim/items/gps">GPS</a> while the event is ongoing, rather than it be a random location, it'll instead say Bloxdonalds.
        - name: This is also a reference to Bus Stop Simulator's Bloxdonalds, where it shares similar details to the Bus Simulator version, but without the dangers that lurk there.
        - name: The runtime of this event is 1 minute and 40 seconds (exactly 100 seconds). This makes the event a similar runtime to the <a href="/bussim/events/cave">Cave</a> event.

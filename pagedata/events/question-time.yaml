          Question Time is an event where <a href='/bussim/npcs/ectta'>Ectta</a> runs up to the bus, 
          making it stop, 
          and asks you a question. 
          You will get a custom chat tag based off of what you answer for 7 minutes. 
          If you do not answer the question on time, 
          you will get an [abstained] tag.

          <br><br>

          After the question has expired for everyone; 
          answered or not, 
          <a href='/bussim/npcs/ectta'>Ectta</a> will then walk onto the sidewalk and dance as the bus moves onwards, 
          ending the event.

          <br><br>

          Currently there are 43 variations of this event so far, 
          if there are any missing, 
          take a screenshot of the question and the answers and list them down in here, 
          thanks! 
          <small>(Also this is very likely subjected to change with Noble adding more variations in the future)</small>

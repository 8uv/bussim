         The Adventure Line is an event based off of the Stanley Parable, 
         and is about the riders of the bus following The Adventure Line<small>TM</small>. 
         The line leads into a sewer grate, 
         and the music is a lower quality version of the original version from the game. 
         The event lasts just short of a minute.

      content:
        - name: The Adventure Line<small>TM</small> is impossible to follow by walking on the path directly without use of Hoverboots, Helicopter, climbing in VR, or even using a Mini-Bus glitch, due to the line going upwards several dozen studs, and having a totally flat surface.
        - name: The audio being lower resolution was potentially due to bypass the ROBLOX audio system, so it can be played in the game.

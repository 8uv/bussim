          <i>Are you looking for more about <a href='/bussim/npcs/steven'>Steven_Scripts</a> himself, instead?</i>

          <br><br>

          Steven Ride event or known as Steven_Scripts (Event), 
          is an event that is almost identical to the <a href='/bussim/events/passengers'>Passengers</a> event in Bus Simulator.
          
          <br><br>

          When this event happens, 
          a black figurine will appear in front of the bus, 
          after the driver allows the mysterious figure to go inside the bus, 
          it is then revealed to be Steven_Scripts himself.

          <br><br>

          The event afterwards will function the same with Steven_Scripts having an assigned timer on random, 
          and jumping off once it expires. 
          If Steven_Scripts' timer expires whilst the Bus is stopped however, 
          Steven_Scripts will briefly do a quick dialogue before flying into space.

          <br><br>

          If however the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a> happens before Steven_Scripts can jump off, 
          you will find him in the Backwalls, 
          violently sobbing in one of the rooms.

          <br><br>

          Lastly, 
          if the same exact event happens while Steven_Scripts is still on the bus, 
          it will instead show a stone statue in a T-pose, 
          before the driver promptly runs it over.

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: While you may not be able to see Steven_Scripts at first glance during his introduction, the harmonica sound effect will still play before and after the introduction.
          children:
            - name: The harmonica sound effect is also be distorted if you spot him in the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a>.
        - name: If Steven_Scripts ride on the Bus and all of the seats in the first floor are filled, Steven_Scripts will instead sit down next to the bathroom, defeated
        - name: Unlike the <a href='/bussim/npcs/steven'>Steven_Scripts</a> found behind <a href='/bussim/events/bloxdonalds'>Bloxdonalds</a>, you can't talk nor interact with him in any way.
          children:
            - name: You can't also annoy both Steven_Scripts using the <a href='/bussim/items/airhorn'>Airhorn</a>, however depending on his position you might accidentally annoy <a href='/bussim/npcs/pear'>Pear</a>.
        - name: The pickup only takes 25 seconds, however the time the event is *truly* over is random.
        - name: Steven_Scripts actually changes his name in the End Dialogue, where he is referred to as Steven instead.
        - name: Steven_Scripts also T-Poses before entering the Bus, akin to his other version where it is a Stone Statue if Steven's already in the Bus.

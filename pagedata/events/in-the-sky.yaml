          The In The Sky event, 
          or known as Falling from the Sky event, 
          is an event that teleports the bus instantly into the skies, 
          making the bus fall down at immense speeds. 
          It is highly recommended not to jump or go to the third floor as you will be instantly blown away from the bus. 
          Eventually though, 
          it ends as the bus falls down back on the ground.

          While this event isn't dangerous in the slightest, 
          you are almost guaranteed to trip over the invisible road once you are blown away, 
          only being protected thanks to the invisible barrier at the end of the road.

      content:
        - name: This is one of the events that changes the map, changing it to the <a href='/bussim/events/space'>Space</a> map.
        - name: Oddly enough, while the event states that the bus is falling from the sky, the player when in mid-air will instead fall straight into the road horizontally, rather than flying upwards as well.
        - name: This event is the fastest event in the game, with 80 mph during the early-mid stages and 185 mph (both shown in the speedometer) in the last stage, this is theoretically enough to time travel as discussed in the <a href='/bussim/events/time-travel'>Time Travel</a> Event, but it can be noted that most of it is likely vertical movement.
        - name: The runtime of this event is 45 seconds, which has the exact same runtime as both the <a href='/bussim/events/bus-birthday'>Bus Birthday</a> and the <a href='/bussim/events/space'>Space</a> events, but also a really similar uptime with the <a href='/bussim/events/exploiter'>Exploiter</a> event.

         The Coffee Shop is an unreleased event in Bus Simulator, being akin of that to Goat Station in terms of cast and similarities. Do note that the following information is only gathered via leaks. <b>IT IS NOT 100% CONFIRMED!</b>
         <br><br>

         When the event starts, The Bus arrives in a city in the middle of the road. The driver then tells everyone to explore around, as The Bus stops on its tracks near a coffee shop.<br></br>
          Throughout the duration of the event, players will be able to go around the city and talk to various NPCs, as well as providing different tasks for Passenger Reputation as compensation. Currently, the confirmed NPCs to appear are Zeon, NobleReign, Tazer, MLG, and some new ones being: Sakura, Inro, Charlotte, and Green (Goat).

          The Coffee Shop or known as [???] is a location within the City that allows players to handle various tasks as a barista, fufilling orders of customers and recieving Passenger Reputation as payment. Multiple talkable NPCs can also be found here.
          <br></br>
          Behind the counters are multiple coffee machines with various ingredients lined up alongside a monitor to display any current Orders. You are then tasked to fufill various orders using the coffee machines and ingredients, and are afterwards paid by your efforts.
          <br></br>
          The coffee types that you can make are in the following:

          You are also able to drink the Coffee as well, including Sludge, which... doesn't taste particularly good. Maybe someone else favors that kind of thing?

          The Garage is a location situated near the Coffee Shop within the city, run by Tazer. You'll be able to customize your Mini-Bus to the E-Bus from one of NobleReign's games: Mini-Bus Racing for the cost of <b>45</b> Passenger Reputation, afterwards once it has been paid for; you'll be able to change it back to the original, and vice versa for free.
          <br></br>
          You can also talk to Tazer about various topics as well, such as the school he used to be sent in, jokes, and his own special drink, in the form of a riddle.

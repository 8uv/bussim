          The nothing event is well... nothing? 
          There isn't much to detail for this event other than a conversation of dialogue between the player and the event, 
          but that's it. 
          There is no hidden features into it, 
          no special dialogue or any happenings, 
          you just wasted 5 minutes of waiting for a single event for nothing, 
          meaning you have to wait another 5 minutes to hopefully not get the same event twice in a row.

        - name: This event for many, is considered useless and objectively so, for it is literally nothing, with <a href='/bussim/events/traffic-light'>Traffic Light</a>, and <a href='/bussim/events/mountain'>Mountain</a> being behind it based on community reception.
          children:
            - name: You can also do an Advanced Force Event specifically for this, but just because you can doesn't mean you should. (You're wasting 120 Robux for nothing)
        - name: The event runtime is 49 seconds.

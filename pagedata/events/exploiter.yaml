         The Exploiter event is an event where an exploiter (of which is not a real exploiter) deletes the road and the terrain. 
         Shortly after some comedic stabs at the creator of the game, 
         the terrain and road restore themselves back to normal, 
         and everything returns back to normal.

      content:
        - name: The sky event and the exploiter event is the only event where the bus floats.
        - name: This is one of the few events that forcibly changes the scenery outside of the bus.
        - name: You can still trip and ragdoll during this event, mainly because the map is set to be invisible rather than actually being deleted.
        - name: The runtime for this event is 46 seconds, meaning that the runtime is similar to both the <a href='/bussim/events/bus-birthday'>Bus Birthday</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/in-the-sky'>In The Sky</a> events.

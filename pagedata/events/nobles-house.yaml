          Noble's House is an event where the bus ends up crashing onto the house owned and lived by Noble, 
          which coincidentally is in the middle of the road. 
          Afterwards the players can go around the house, 
          finding a <a href='/bussim/items/gameboy-advance'>hidden gameboy link</a> behind Noble's Desktop, 
          a <a href='/bussim/items/cola'>Cola</a> and <a href='/bussim/items/cold-cola'>Cold Cola</a> from the fridge, 
          and an interact-able TV and remote. 
          Following a few minutes after, 
          the bus driver destroys Noble's house further until the bus breaks past and then the event ends afterwards.

      content:
        - name: Noble's Desktop has a chance to have different decals, being single colors but also rarely; the stereotypical green furry used by new furs.
        - name: When going on Channel 3 in the TV, it will instead display the players that are watching it based on a range instead of a typical "Most Robux Wasted" leaderboards.
        - name: When you go inside the fridge, you will end up being electrocuted to death with hidden laser beams inside.
        - name: <a href='/bussim/npcs/noble'>NobleReign</a> (in-game, not the real guy) doesn't acknowledge nor know the existence of <a href='/bussim/npcs/frostbite'>Frostbite</a>, and vice versa; despite the latter being Noble's fursona.
        - name: The event runtime is 1 minute and 32 seconds, about the same length as the <a href='/bussim/events/cave'>Cave</a> event.

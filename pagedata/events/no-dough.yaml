          The No Dough event is an event where the bus runs out of gas, 
          but nobody can afford to buy gas. 
          The bus then pulls up at a house, 
          with the passengers needing to break in via chimney to get some money and escape unnoticed. 
          The house is randomized per event including decoration and furniture, 
          so there is no clear way on how to get to the money every time. 
          You are given 10 minutes to find the stash of money. 
          if somebody finds it,
          everybody participating in the event is given 5 minutes to return back to the bus via escaping the same way you enter, 
          and people can't re-enter.

          <br><br>

          During Christmas of 2021, 
          the event was first seen as "<a href='/bussim/events/santas-gone'>Santa's Gone</a>", 
          where the gameplay is super similar to No Dough, 
          but you accidentally run over Santa, 
          and have to break into their house to deliver the presents to the Christmas Tree. 
          You could also obtain the "Master Escapee" badge and The Bringer of Gifts badge, 
          where you would unlock the <a href='/bussim/items/candied-cane'>Candied Cane</a>. 
          You can't obtain these badges in a VIP server.

          <br><br>

          Some items also get revoked when you enter the chimney. 
          The following are the items that get removed on entry:

          There may be more items that get removed.

          <br><br>

          The rest of the items can be used, 
          but have a unique factor. 
          Their sound effects are treated as audible noise, 
          which will alert nearby house guests on the floor, 
          depending on the volume. 
          The <a href='/bussim/items/airhorn'>airhorn</a> is the loudest item, 
          which alerts everybody on the floor, 
          and the Phone is the quietest, 
          having a small range. 
          Noise can be useful to move NPCs to a different area, 
          making it easier to find the money unnoticed, 
          if you can get past how many NPCs you alerted.

          <br><br>

          There are several NPCs in the house, 
          which shares the same ID generation as the <a href='/bussim/events/passenger'>Passengers event</a> (so you can see some "special characters", like NobleReigns friends), 
          and will spot you if you are in their line of sight for a little while, 
          killing you. 
          You cannot be spotted while ragdolled.

          Obby is a simple event in Bus Simulator, 
          where the bus briefly stops at a small obby next to the sidewalk of the road. 
          The players can choose to complete it in any way possible, 
          being awarded with a can of <a href='/bussim/items/hyper-soda'>Hyper Soda</a> at the end. 
          The event ends shortly afterwards.

          The Mountain is a pretty basic event in Bus Simulator, 
          where the bus stops at a nearby mountain, 
          after a while the driver tells everyone to get back to the bus, 
          and the event ends. 
          You may encounter ducks in a pond that quack occasionally.

        - name: The models for the mountains are always kept constant due to when the mountains was first released, being before biomes existed. Therefore regardless of biome the model won't change.
        - name: If this event rolls in the <a href='/bussim/biomes/lava'>Lava</a> biome, its water is coincidentally deep enough that you will end up being burnt just by stepping on it.
        - name: This was one of the events added in the poll for the next events, despite it being placed 2nd, it still got added later on.
        - name: After this event's debut, many people wanted this event to be removed due to the inaccuracy to actual mountains and the lack of anything special to it, however after following a poll in the Bus SImulator Updates discord server, it was decided to keep it in.

            - name: It still has not been updated ever since, but never removed.

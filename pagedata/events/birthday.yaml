         Bus Birthday is an event where a random player is chosen to be celebrated for their birthday. 
         The player will get a <a href='/bussim/items/birthday-ice-cream'>Birthday Ice Cream</a> instantly, 
         and everyone will get <a href='/bussim/items/free-modelled-cake'>Free-modelled Cake</a> shortly. 
         "Happy birthday to you" will be played during the event, 
         but on kazoo. 
         A large part will also hover above the bus, 
         emitting particle confetti over it. 
         The event then ends, 
         however you'll keep both items until you die.

      content:
        - name: The birthday player is completely random and while it happening during your real birthday is purely coincidental, it is completely possible!
        - name: There's a chance that the player will not recieve the <a href='/bussim/items/birthday-ice-cream'>Birthday Ice Cream</a>, even if they were chosen as the birthday person.
        - name: The event has 45 seconds of runtime, which has the exact same amount of runtime as both the <a href='/bussim/events/in-the-sky'>In The Sky</a> and the <a href='/bussim/events/space'>Space</a> events. There's also a really similar runtime with the <a href='/bussim/events/exploiter'>Exploiter</a> event.
        - name: The <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N63GSop8Xz4&ab_channel=tidlfqpahn'>audio</a> originated from a birthday kazoo youtube video that was published in Sep 16, 2014.

          The Repaint Event is an event that happens every 5 minutes at random, 
          giving players the option to vote for what color that should be painted onto <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>The Bus</a> for around 16-20 minutes (or roughly 3-4 events).

          <br><br>

          There are 8 different colors to choose from, 
          and each of them will paint the bus, 
          slowly fading back to the natural color after the event has concluded.

          <br><br>

          In the event that two or more colors are voted the most however, 
          the paint will instead be roughly distributed around the bus, 
          with a two-way tie being 50/50, 
          to an impossible eight-way tie. 
          You'll also get the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/badges/2130114796/Colorful-Chaos">Colorful Chaos</a> if you get a four-way or higher tie.

          children:
            - name: "Similarly, parts of the Bus that are colored manually will be the new default color, with paints only being layered on top of it. This can be seen outside of using Edit by doing the event during Halloween."

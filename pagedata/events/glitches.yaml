          The Glitches Event is an event that slowly starts changing biomes, 
          and gets faster per biome change. 
          The event goes through every biome in the game, 
          including one that is only seen via !map in a VIP server, 
          or in the <a href='/bussim/events/exploiter'>Exploiter</a> event, 
          the <a href='/bussim/biomes/void'>Void</a> biome.

          This map isn't recommended to watch if you have epilepsy, 
          so if you start seeing the dialogue "Driving down the road is pretty relaxing." after an event, 
          look away for about one minute.

        - name: The dialogue "Who programmed this game? A child?" is a comedic jab at NobleReign, as he is indeed a child... mostly.
        - name: This is one of the few events that forcibly changes biome, without the need of a tunnel.
        - name: This event has a runtime of exactly 1 minute (60 seconds), which has the exact same amount of runtime as the <a href='/bussim/events/shack'>Shack</a> event, and a similar amount of runtime with the <a href='/bussim/events/bacon-hair'>Bacon Hair</a> event.

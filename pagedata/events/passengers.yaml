          The passenger event is a very simple event, 
          where the bus stops at a stop as passengers hop inside the bus. 
          A player will say "This feels similar to another game", 
          a reference to Bus Stop Simulator and the event ends. 
          The NPCs are randomly generated from existing user IDs, 
          and there's a chance you can see NobleReigns friends.

          Even though the event has ended, 
          the passengers will still remain inside the bus at random times, 
          eventually when that random time expires the NPC passenger opens the door and hops right off, 
          similar to the Steven_Scripts Event. 
          Unfortunately this doesn't seem to have any special effects when landing safely or if a Backwalls Event happened before the passengers could get off.

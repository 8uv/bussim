          In Bus Simulator, 
          you are able to play smaller games while waiting for events to arise mostly thanks to both the <a href='/bussim/items/gameboy-advance'>Gameboy Advance</a>, 
          and the <a href='/bussim/items/roemulator'>RoEmulator</a>, 
          while three of them are locked behind a paywall, 
          you can still have extra fun while waiting between events on the bus.

        title: Simon Says
        description: >-
         Simon Says is a simple memory game that tests how long you can remember the pattern. 
         Every round randomizes the color sequence, 
         and adds one additional color to it (1 -> 2 -> 3...). 
         If you beat the global/server high score, 
         you will hear a party blower, 
         confetti will pop out, 
         and your username/display name will show up on the slip of paper next to it, 
         and has your quote underneath it, 
         if you set one via !quote.

        description: >- 
          <br>
          Adventure island is a side-scroller game that lasts up until the 4th level, 
          in which it ends. 
          You play as a caveman, 
          throwing axes at enemies and collecting fruits, 
          while reaching the goal without spending too much energy or dying.

          <br><br>

          Each fruit will give you more energy, 
          and energy depletes over time. 
          You can also encounter objects that can boost your movement along the stage.

          Race the Sunset is an endless side-scroller game where you play as a slime dashing ontop of islands, 
          collecting orbs to get points. 
          The further you get, 
          the faster the game is, 
          and the more points you score.

          <br>
          Lunar Lander is a space-themed flying game where you have to pick up a box and bring it back to the surface. 
          The game only has 8 levels, 
          varying in difficulty. 
          If you go too fast and crash into a wall, 
          fail to escort the box, 
          among a few other methods, 
          it's game over.

        title: Battle Wagons
        description: >- 
          <br>
          You and the other player set up five wagons on a 11x9 piece, 
          and try guessing where the enemy wagons are on the top half. 
          The players get a five-tile long wagon, 
          as well as four, 
          three (x2), 
          and two-tile wagons. 
          Both players start with five shoots, 
          one per wagon. 
          If you lose a wagon, 
          you get one less shot, 
          making your turns more strategic the more you lose your wagons. 
          The game is more focused on trial and error, 
          to find where the enemy wagons are. 
          White pegs on the top of the board is a miss, 
          while red ones are a hit.

          On display you'll be able to see the player who queued the song as well as what song in particular that's being played. You can also either bass boost the next song in queue, or replace the next default song in queue with a manually selected song using the audio ID or by searching it up. Intermissions also appear at most every 5 songs, manually queued or not and cannot be replaced by queued songs. It also often appears whenever the server starts.

          There's also a couple of minor details such as the radio having a visualizer as well as having the in-game time more accurate compared to the Phone.

          The visualizer also comes in two different styles, being both found in Performance Settings and be disabled as an option. It goes as follows:

          children:
            - name: Uses the old radio visualizer where hard beats often light up the screen from the bottom.
        
        - name: >-
            Off
          children:
            - name: Completely disables the visualizer.

            Spectrum
          children:
            - name: Uses a new radio visualizer made by Roblox and completely visualizes the music being played. Automatically turns on at graphics level 8+ by default. 
              children:
                - name: If the song has no audio, it'll instead visualize a wave.

            You can also search up using either the name of the song, or with advanced filters like song length, authors, etc, with the maximum song length being 15 minutes, consuming a single song that you have (with the exception being Private Servers).
            <br> </br>
            You can get more songs by:

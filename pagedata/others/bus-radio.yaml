          On display you'll be able to see the player who queued the song as well as what song in particular that's being played. You can also either bass boost the next song in queue, or replace the next default song in queue with a manually selected song using the audio ID or by searching it up. Intermissions also appear at most every 5 songs, manually queued or not and cannot be replaced by queued songs. It also often appears whenever the server starts.
          <br> </br>
          There's also a couple of minor details such as the radio having a visualizer as well as having the in-game time more accurate compared to the Phone. 
          <br> </br>
          The visualizer also comes in two different styles, being both found in Performance Settings and be disabled as an option. It goes as follows:

            Classic
          children:
            - name: Uses the old radio visualizer where hard beats often light up the screen from the bottom.
        
        - name: >-
            Off
          children:
            - name: Completely disables the visualizer.
        
        - name: >-
            Spectrum
          children:
            - name: Uses a new radio visualizer made by Roblox and completely visualizes the music being played. Automatically turns on at graphics level 8+ by default. 
              children:
                - name: If the song has no audio, it'll instead visualize a wave.

            You can also search up using either the name of the song, or with advanced filters like song length, authors, etc, with the maximum song length being 15 minutes, consuming a single song that you have (with the exception being Private Servers).
            <br> </br>
            You can get more songs by: 
    
    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: Buying the Bus Driver Gamepass and joining every day. (5)
        - name: Receive it as special rewards during an event like New Years or on other happy occassions. (5)
        - name: Receive it when someone buys free songs for everyone, including themselves via Pear. (2)
        - name: Purchase a single song yourself for only 10 Robux, if you don't have any free songs.

              children:
                - name: "The radio station had to move to a different number, due to the FCC not approving their setup."
        - name: "There used to be a ridiculously expensive gamepass that allowed you to host songs up to 2 hours, but after a few updates it got removed. Only a few people have bought it.<br></br>"

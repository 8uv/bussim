          During the event, 
          the <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>bus</a> also has firework launchers attached to the third floor, 
          which will periodically launch fireworks into the sky. 
          The free stuff, 
          as well as the fireworks, 
          both disappear on January 1st, 
          so make sure to get as much free stuff as you can.

          Commands are a feature in Bus Simulator used to change small elements of the game, 
          such as chat tag customisation and private server commands.

          <br><br>

          Most commands use the ! prefix, 
          excluding the default emote command,
          which requires /e instead. 
          This page will list all of the commands you can do both in public and private servers.

          These commands are used by the Bus Simulator Moderator / Admin team to moderate the game. 
          They have more power than Private Server commands. 
          You can also have a similar power by joining your Private Server, 
          assuming somebody else is already in it.

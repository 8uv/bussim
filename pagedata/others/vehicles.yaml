         In Bus Simulator, 
         when you have vehicles enabled by default in the Performance Settings (On by default.), 
         vehicles will spawn in the road besides the bus. 
         The vehicles you may encounter can be comprised of six types :

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: Normal Car - Goes at a random speed, from slow to fast.
        - name: SUV - Goes at a normal speed, a bit different from your average car.
        - name: Police Car - Naturally goes quite fast.
        - name: Motorcycle - A bacon hair will ride a motorcycle in a fast speed, when collided with a vehicle it'll cause a deepened OOF sound.
        - name: Ice Cream Truck - A truck that goes moderately fast and stops when the bus stops, being able to hand out ice creams.
        - name: Truck - A slow moving truck that might cause some collateral damage on collision.

          If any of those six vehicles collide either by speed and such, 
          it'll cause an explosion and eventually the two collided vehicles despawn momentarily. 
          When you also attempt to jump onto any of the six vehicles, 
          you may also be subjected into being flinged in extreme velocity unless if you are holding or using the Mini Bus, 
          in this case; 
          you won't be tripped nor flung.

        title: Ice Cream Truck
        description: >- 
          The ice cream truck is a special vehicle, 
          only stopping when the bus stops (even after it spawns). 
          When you click on the window the Ice Cream Man will give you an Ice Cream or very rarely, 
          the Last <a href='/bussim/items/spronkbib-popsicle'>Spronkbib Popsicle</a>. (1/800, used to be 1/1000.)

          <br><br>

          If you try to talk to it while the bus is still moving, 
          it says that it can't give you an ice cream at that speed. 
          If you also attempt to get another without resetting, 
          it'll mention that he needs to give ice cream to everyone.

          <br><br>

          However, 
          getting an ice cream is easier than done, 
          as the truck will either:

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: Go too far from when the bus has stopped.
        - name: When the bus hasn't stopped yet.
        - name: It has collided onto another vehicle.
        - name: Too early to reach with just walking.

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: The vehicles will not follow any traffic laws as mentioned with the collision, and it doesn't also follow any rule that the bus does during the <a href='/bussim/events/traffic-light'>Traffic</a> event.
        - name: The vehicles also don't seem to spawn in the same lane as the bus. It could be a bus lane, but there isn't any proof to confirm this.
        - name: Despite the <a href='/bussim/items/mini-bus'>Mini Bus</a> being and acting like a vehicle, it doesn't share similar properties to the other vehicles mentioned.
        - name: Since Ice Cream Trucks can spawn at the very start of the road when the bus has stopped, you might need to use the <a href='/bussim/items/mini-bus'>Mini Bus</a> or anything fast to get past the invisible barrier.
        - name: In very rare cases, ramming vehicles with the <a href='/bussim/items/mini-bus'>Mini Bus</a> at high speeds (such as getting a large Mini-Boost prior to drifting) can cause vehicles to verge off course. This could be leveraged to intentionally make vehicles crash.

        description: >- 
          In Bus Simulator, 
          there are currently six cosmetics in the game, 
          and they are exclusive to a specific player. 
          While the page will not list their ROBLOX username, 
          we will show the cosmetics, 
          and what they go by online. 
          The cosmetics can also be seen in Kit Battle.

          <br><br>

          Note: Only these players have access to their own cosmetics, 
          and you cannot get them by simply asking for one. 
          All of these cosmetics are also hard to come by normally. 
          All images will be pulled from the <a href="https://kit-battle.fandom.com/wiki/Cosmetics">Kit Battle</a> page under the same name. 
          Majority of these players also don't play Bus Sim and Kit Battle frequently anymore, 
          making all but Tazer's very rare to see.

         <i>Zeon no longer wears her cosmetic, and isn't possible to see in-game anymore.</i>
        
         <br><br>

         Zeon has the most advanced cosmetic. 
         She has several expressions, 
         that reacts to damage. 
         It also makes beeps when damage was taken.

          NobleReign also has a special cosmetic if he wears the Build-A-Fur Wolf set, 
          in which his eyes turn blue, 
          his sclera turns white, 
          and his fur color matches the one with his shirt. 
          This same effect can also be seen in Noble's alt being ColdWolfFrost, 
          or Frostbite himself.

          There are billboards in the game that appears on the sides of the road around every 3 minutes and 30 seconds. 
          The billboards showcase real advertisements to companies, such as <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H%26M'>H&M</a> and 
          <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nike,_Inc'>Nike</a>, for example. These billboards can only be seen if your account age is 13+, 
          as they cannot be advertised to people if they are 12 or younger.

          <br><br>

          At the launch of the update (On March 31st, 2023), 
          only one person (At least, who brought it up) has seen an actual advertisement in the game, 
          as the system barely has any advertisers so far. 
          If no advertisement shows up, 
          the ROBLOX logo will appear instead.

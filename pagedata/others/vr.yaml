         with varying degrees of compatibility. 
         For Bus Simulator, 
         VR is mostly compatible with little to no hinderance, 
         and even offers you a few perks for playing with a headset.

          To set up playing Bus Simulator with a wired VR cable, 
          you need to allow unknown sources. 
          (This can be found in Settings > General). 
          To start, 
          you need one of the following:

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: A USB 3.1 port
        - name: Oculus Link Cable (1st or 3rd party)
        - name: VR-Ready Computer Device
        - name: Rift/Rift S Headset

          <br>
          Roblox can work with non-Oculus VR products, 
          but may not work properly, 
          as ROBLOX only has proper support for Oculus. 
          You need one of the following to work:

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: Virtual Desktop (Not Recommended)
        - name: SteamVR installed and properly set up
        - name: Link cable

          If you own an Oculus Quest 2,
          you can play Bus Simulator. 
          To do so, you need:

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: A compatible PC
        - name: 5hz network
        - name: Meet the Oculus link requirements (More info <a href='https://www.meta.com/help/quest/articles/headsets-and-accessories/oculus-link/meta-quest-link-compatibility/'>here</a>.)

        title: Item Usage
        description: >- 
          All of the items you obtained/purchased will spawn in your inventory, 
          just like you're playing normally. 
          Also, 
          all of the items from events and on the bus can be picked up. 
          Unfortunately, 
          most of them will not work now, 
          if ever.

        description: >- 
          You can enjoy Bus Simulator the same way that everybody else does,

          <br>
          To chat in VR, 
          look at your right wrist, 
          and simple hold own your right trigger. 
          A keyboard will pop up, 
          and you can start typing by pointing at the key and pulling the respected trigger for which key you're pointing at (i.e. Left Hand over the letter G).

          and saves specifically for the platform. 
          To access them,

        title: Controls
        description: >- 
          Note: This page only goes over any additional controls that NobleReign has added.

          <br><br>

          Your triggers can also be used to climb, 
          a useful feature in NobleReigns games. 
          You can hold onto and climb any surface with collision enabled, 
          and scale anything you want, 
          which gives you an edge over other players, 
          as this can be used as an easy way to traverse tall gaps without items like <a href='/bussim/items/hoverboots'>Hoverboots</a>. 
          You also obtain <a href='/bussim/items'>items</a>, 
          interact with <a href='/bussim/npcs'>characters</a>, 
          and other features.

          <br><br>

          If you have the Teleportation movement enabled from the Nexus menu, 
          push your analog triggers up, 
          and hover the marker (Blue circle and green sphere) to where you wanna teleport to. 
          You can teleport with both analog sticks, 
          but only one can be used at a time, 
          and teleporting has no cooldown.

          <br><br>

          You can also right click to open your inventory, 
          allowing you to select an item you want to use. 
          If you have a Valve Index, 
          you can also use the touchpad.

          <br>
          As stated before, 
          the Mini-Bus can be driven in VR, 
          but has its own unique controls.

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: Hold down the right trigger to start driving.
        - name: Hold down the left trigger to to slow down/go in reverse.
        - name: Hold the jump button (A/Grip on Index) to start drifting.
        - name: Tilt your arms in the direction you want to go to steer. Using one arm rotates half as much, compared to both arms.

        title: Your Wrists
        description: >- 
          Your wrists have some important features. 
          Your right wrist will have the Chat, 
          and your left wrist will have the Event messages, 
          as well as your ping, 
          frames per second (FPS), 
          and server info. 
          This is useful for when you want to know whats happening, 
          or couldn't read the text somebody sent.

        title: Issues

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: When first joining in VR, if you chat, you sometimes won't get a tag that says "[VR]". This mainly happens to Non-Oculus users.
        - name: When small, you can run extremely fast, but climbing is harder to do.
        - name: When you're outside of the bus (doesn't include locations like Backwalls and No Dough/Santa's Missing), and the bus speeds up via event or commands, you will be pushed to the back of the world, by the door.
        - name: If you're holding onto an object with collision and it disappears (i.e. Traffic Light), you're able to hold onto it as long as you keep the trigger held.
        - name: Other players can physically get in the way of your keyboard when you're trying to type.
        - name: When you put away the Mini-Bus, some of your accessories will be visible in your view, the issue varies depending on how many accessories appear in front of your avatar.

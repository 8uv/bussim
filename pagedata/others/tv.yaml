         The Television,
          or TV for short, 
          is an interactive prop that appears both in <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>The Bus</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/nobles-house'>Noble's House</a>.
          
          <br><br>

          The TV has 12 channels, 
          with some of which, 
          e.g. the donation leaderboard, 
          being dynamic. 
          There are remotes in the previously mentioned places, 
          with the Blue Button incrementing the channel, 
          and the Red Button turning the TV off or on. 
          If the channel goes past 12, 
          it'll loop back to 1.

          <br><br>

          The TV in The Bus can only be changed if you are currently in the driver's seat.

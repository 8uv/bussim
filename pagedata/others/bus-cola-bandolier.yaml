         The Bandolier seems to be a torso strap-on made with a sky-blue fabric. 
         On the bandolier contains the following colas; 
         left to right being: 
         <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/cold-cola">Cold Cola</a>, <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/bad-cola">Bad Cola</a>, <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/hot-cola">Hot Cola</a>, and <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/cramped-cola">Cramped Cola</a>. 
         The cola texture themselves also seem to be in much lower resolution and scale than their official game counterparts.

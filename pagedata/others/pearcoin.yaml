         The pearcoin is a gamepass that is only obtainable through <a href='/bussim/npcs/pear'>Pear</a>, 
         or through somebody's inventory, 
         and costs 2 R$ to purchase. 
         The item doesn't appear in your inventory.
         All the pearcoin does is give you extra dialogues for <a href='/bussim/npcs/frostbite'>Frostbite</a>, 
         <a href='/bussim/npcs/pear'>Pear</a>, 
         and <a href='/bussim/npcs/disc'>Disc</a>. 
         The gamepass is meant to be an "investment", 
         but is actually just a scam, 
         like cryptocurrency. 
         You can only have one pearcoin at a time. 
         If you show the pearcoin to Frostbite, 
         he will immediately gain your trust (if you give him an <a href='/bussim/items/ice-cream'>Ice Cream</a> before, however.)

         <br><br>

         Anytime the pearcoin gets brought up by a character, 
         it always has wavy rainbow text.

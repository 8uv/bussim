          In certain biomes, 
          some weather can be changed to fit accordingly and so often have their own special effects:

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: For <a href='/bussim/biomes/snowy'>Snowy</a>, during Rainy, it is replaced by snow particles around the player. This is then intensified during Stormy.
        - name: For <a href='/bussim/biomes/frozen'>Frozen</a>, hail will begin to occur during Rainy, with it intensifying during Stormy.
        - name: For <a href='/bussim/biomes/lava'>Lava</a>, rain is practically non-existent for both Rainy and Stormy.
        - name: For <a href='/bussim/biomes/desert'>Desert</a>, no effects happen during Rainy, however a sandstorm begins if the weather is Stormy, with dust particles flying to the North.

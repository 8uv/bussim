          The D.I.Y. Minibus is an official accessory that you can buy <a href="https://www.roblox.com/catalog/14448729069/D-I-Y-Minibus">here</a>. 
          The accessory, 
          if worn in-game, 
          will change colors based off of what color you set with !color if you have the <a href='/bussim/items/mini-bus'>Mini-Bus</a> gamepass. 
          Otherwise it'll act as a normal waist accessory in any other game on Roblox.

          <br><br>

          You can also buy it in one of the cabinets in the first floor of <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>The Bus</a>, 
          displayed as a very miniature figure.

        description: >-
         The D.I.Y. Minibus is made out of cardboard with the exterior colors being based off of your Mini-Bus, 
         with the front having some crudely drawn headlights, 
         as well as a 2D drawing of a Noob driving, 
         and white outlines of seats and stairs in the back. 
         The sides has fake windows, 
         and tires with only the front-facing surfaced colored. 
         The back also has a fake window, 
         as well as two tiny antennas, 
         red brake lights, 
         and a license plate saying "PLAY BUS SIM". 
         The interior has a cardboard seat and a steering wheel.

         Overseas is a biome that will spawn randomly after driving through a tunnel. 
         It comprises of the street being a bridge and the terrain being completely non-existent. 
         It also has a similar haze to Nostalgia among a few others.<br><br>Unlike other biomes, 
         This biome allows players to fall off the road, causing them to drown in the process. 
         It is highly recommended you don't drive a <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/mini-bus">Minibus</a> recklessly here if you prefer to keep your inventory.

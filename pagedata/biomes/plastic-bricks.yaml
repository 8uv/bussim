          Plastic Bricks is a biome that appears with a Smooth Plastic material in green. 
          A unique tree mesh and red plastic bricks spawn on the terrain, 
          as well as buildings. The biome used to be called LEGO, 
          but was changed potentially due to copyright reasons.

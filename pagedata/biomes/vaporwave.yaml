          The Vaporwave biome is a biome that is very different than the rest, 
          which uses a lot of pink and black. The buildings are black with pink outlines, 
          and the ground is a grid with pink lines and black squares. Whenever it rains, 
          the rain appears pink as well.

          For some odd reason, the moon in this biome is gigantic compared to anywhere else.

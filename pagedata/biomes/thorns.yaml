         Thorns is a biome that will spawn randomly after driving through a tunnel. 
         It has a darker appearance, with many large, thorn-like spikes around the area. 
         The biome is based off of The Landscape of Thorns, which is a physical marker for how dangerous the area is for people in the future.

         <br><br>

         Thorns is dark and bleak, and has plenty of thorns scattered around the area, 
         as a physical marker for radiation. No non-event buildings, 
         hills, foliage, or crashed helicopters will spawn in this biome.

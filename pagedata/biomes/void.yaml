         The Void biome is a biome that cannot be forced by the !biome command,
         but instead can be seen in two events, <a href='/bussim/events/exploiter'>Exploiter</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/glitches'>Glitches</a>,
         as well as with the !map command. The biome appears completely blank and lacks a road. The collision for the road and ground exists, but it cannot be seen.
         Vehicles cannot spawn in this biome, either.

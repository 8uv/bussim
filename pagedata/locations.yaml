            listItemTitle: Art Gallery
            listItemDescription: >-
              The gallery is composed of many pictures, whom of which are made by artists with conveyor belts around the map as well as jump-pads  from LittleBigPlanet 2 to help you traverse,
              currently there are 34 different fan arts as of the time of editing (June 24, 2023), possibly more in the future including the ability to take a full view of any art that you click on.
              There are also podiums for everyone who has contributed to the game thus far.

            listItemTitle: Backwalls
            listItemDescription: >-
              The Backwalls is a rare event where a person mentions about the bus having a few hiccups or something isn't feeling right, afterwards all players (assuming they are not in Frost's Den) are teleported into the Backwalls.

            listItemTitle: Beter Box
            listItemDescription: >-
              The Beter Box is a small box located in front of the <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>Bus</a> outside, the box itself is rather small and has multiple moving images of Peter Griffin,
              as well as one in the center, which will always look at you. The box cannot be seen that well on the outside unless if you get close to it
              which the outside of it is vaguely visible. The Beter Box is difficult to enter without the use of Transportation items, such as <a href='/bussim/items/hoverboots'>Hoverboots</a> or <a href='/bussim/items/helicopters'>Helicopters</a>,
              but still possible to do if you do it right, as there is a small ledge you can jump onto, which will help you get in. If you succeed, you will receive a badge for entering the box for the first time.

            listItemTitle: Bloxdonalds
            listItemDescription: The Bloxdonalds is both an Event and a Location in Bus Simulator.

          - listItemImage: /bussim-assets/images/locations/the-door.webp
            listItemTitle: The Door
            listItemDescription: >-
              The Door is an entrance point that is always a considerable distance behind the bus, sitting next to a few wooden planks. You can get to the door by using <a href='/bussim/items/hoverboots'>Hoverboots</a> or <a href='/bussim/items/helicopters'>Helicopters</a> (the latter requires a speed boost from an item such as <a href='/bussim/items/almond-water'>Almond Water</a> to cover the distance)
              while timing your descent just right to trigger the door, or by waiting until the Bus is stopped by an event, and travelling over to it.

          - listItemImage: /bussim-assets/images/locations/glacier-cave.webp
            listItemTitle: Glacier Cave
            listItemDescription: >-
              The interior is a massive cave filled with crystals, on the left there is a hidden passage way that appears to be a parkour that leads to NamerElf's actual spot. (While NamerElf is credited; it isn't present in its podium in the Art Gallery.)

            listItemTitle: GPS Locations
            listItemDescription: >-
              The <a href='/bussim/items/gps'>GPS</a> lists locations that the Bus is currently in, and this is the list that shows most of them.
              They're all just cosmetic, and have no correlation to the biome you're in. There are 396 locations so far in this list (excluding "Recalculating.." and event-exclusive locations [e.g. 2648 Goat Ave <a href='/bussim/events/goated-gas-station'>Goat Station</a>], including Routes [e.g. Route 27]).
              If you find a location that isn't on this list, feel free to add one to this list by editing this page on the Repository!

            listItemTitle: The Bus
            listItemDescription: >-
              The Bus is the main part and theme of this entire game, it is composed of 3 different floors with about more than 40 seats distributed all over the floors including items and props.

            listItemTitle: Void
            listItemDescription: >-
              The Void is a medium-sized black room that has two monitors in the top-right corner with <a href='/bussim/npcs/efuc'>Efuc</a> laying down next to them,
              and a sign simply saying "back", which being clicked or tapped on, will take you back to the front of the second floor on the <a href='/bussim/locations/the-bus'>The Bus</a>.

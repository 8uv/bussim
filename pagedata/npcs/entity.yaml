        quote: The entities around here are kinda scary... I tried to hide away in a room when one spotted me, but it still knew where I was..! I guess they can still track you for a bit when you're out of sight...

          The AI they have works like the NPC's found in <a href='/bussim/events/no-dough'>No Dough</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/santas-gone'>Santa's Gone</a> except a few major differences.

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: If they spot a player in the Backwalls they will check the area where they last spotted them.
        - name: They don't get distracted to any items (Example <a href='/bussim/items/airhorn'>Airhorn</a>, <a href='/bussim/items/spronkbib-popsicle'>Spronkbib Popsicle</a>, etc) making them nearly useless.
        - name: Their speed increases when they fully spotted a player.
        - name: Sometimes, Entities can bundle up in an area, making it harder/impossible to pass through without <a href='/bussim/items/liquid-void'>Liquid Void</a>.
        - name: If you get spotted, you will be stunned for a second, much like getting spotted in No Dough. But you don't die immediately.

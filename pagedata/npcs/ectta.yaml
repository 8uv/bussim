        - name: If you combine all of the possible variants Ectta could use, Ectta would have a total of 190,512 dialogue options, or 4,536 if excluding the variants from <a href='/bussim/events/question-time'>Question Time</a>. <small>(This is prone to change the more Question Time variants as well as dialogue gets added, always update it to the latest after an update, thanks!)</small>
          children:
            - name: This technically makes him have the most amount of dialogue in Bus Simulator, assuming that a combination of variants can be counted as one. But if not, then that title holds to <a href='/bussim/npcs/d6'>D6</a>.
        - name: Ectta cannot be annoyed by the <a href='/bussim/items/airhorn'>Airhorn</a>.
        - name: It used to be possible to make Ectta fall over at times when he was being moved by players during his respective event. This has been patched out in an undetermined update to the game.
        - name: Ectta currently has the most amount of choices available to the player in the game, with a total of 9 choices in the 34th variation of his question in <a href='/bussim/events/question-time'>Question Time</a>.

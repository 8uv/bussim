        - name: Although NobleReign has a fursona called Frostbite, within the game Noble doesn't acknowledge the existence of <a href='/bussim/npcs/frostbite'>Frostbite</a>, and neither does Frostbite.
        - name: Unlike other NPCs, you can't annoy NobleReign with an <a href='/bussim/items/airhorn'>airhorn</a>.
        - name: This is one of the only NPCs in the game that still uses the Event Textbox instead of the new NPC Dialouge system that other NPCs use. (ex. Frostbite, MLG, D1sc, T4zer, etc.)

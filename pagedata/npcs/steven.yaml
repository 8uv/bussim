        title: Trivia

    - type: tree
      content:
        - name: Compared to the many other talkative NPCs in the game, Steven_Scripts cannot be annoyed using an <a href='/bussim/items/airhorn'>Airhorn</a>.
          children:
            - name: Steven also has no new dialogue regardless if you are friends with them, similar to <a href='/bussim/npcs/tazer'>Tazer</a> and other NPCs.
            - name: Depending on Steven's location in Steven Ride, you might also accidentally trigger <a href='/bussim/npcs/pear'>Pear</a>.
        - name: If Steven_Scripts in Steven Ride fails to exit the Bus before the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a> event happens, he can be spotted in the walls / corners of a room, violently sobbing.
        - name: If the Steven Ride event is trigged while Steven is already on the bus, it will result in encountering what seems to be a humanoid shaped stone in front of the bus instead of Steven. It then gets run over by the bus and collapses, ending the event.
        - name: While you may not be able to see Steven_Scripts at first glance during his introduction, the harmonica sound effect will still play before and after the introduction.
          children:
            - name: The harmonica sound effect is also be distorted if you spot him in the <a href='/bussim/events/backwalls'>Backwalls</a>.
        - name: If Steven_Scripts ride on the Bus and all of the seats on the first floor are filled, Steven_Scripts will instead sit down next to the bathroom, defeated.

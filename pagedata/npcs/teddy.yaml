         Teddy is an NPC that appears most often in his events: 
         being both <a href='/bussim/events/teddy'>Micspam</a> and <a href='/bussim/events/teddy/mic-off'>Micoff</a>. 
         He also has a special effect where his shadow is that of a large circle, 
         rather than raycasted off of his body.

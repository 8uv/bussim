         Frostbite (or known as Frost in-game) is an NPC that only appears in the <a href='/bussim/events/glacier-cave'>Glacier Cave</a> event. 
         As soon as you enter his den for the first time, 
         Frost will be surprised at your arrival, 
         however he allows you to explore his den but without your trust.

         <br><br>

         It is known that Frost is a childhood friend of Pear, 
         which may come fruitful in the two methods to obtain badges.

        title: Trust
        description: >-
          rost has a unique mechanic compared to most NPCs, 
          where he has different dialogue based on his trust level which goes from 0 to 2 at max. 
          In order to fully gain Frost's trust, 
          you can give him an <a href='/bussim/items/ice-cream'>Ice Cream</a> and <a href='/bussim/items/pearcoin'>Pearcoin</a> to make him trust you. 
          Or by giving him the Spronkbib Popsicle.

          <br><br>

          The latter choice is locked if you decide to give him Ice Cream instead.

          <br><br>

          Maxing out his trust by offering the <a href='/bussim/items/spronkbib-popsicle'>Spronkbib Popsicle</a> (or showing <a href='/bussim/items/pearcoin'>Pearcoin</a> following the <a href='/bussim/items/ice-cream'>Ice Cream</a>) will give you a badge <a href='https://www.roblox.com/badges/2130010648/Part-of-the-Pack'>Part of the Pack</a>, 
          and is necessary to unlock the second one. 
          His dialogue and choices also change afterwards.

          <br><br>

          Certain items can also be offered, 
          however they don't provide any trust such as <a href='/bussim/items/gas-station-ice-cream'>Gas Station Ice Creams</a> and <a href='/bussim/items/birthday-ice-cream'>Birthday Ice Cream</a>.

        - name: Frost is <a href='/bussim/npcs/noble'>NobleReign's</a> fursona.
          children:
            - name: Despite this, both Noble and Frost don't know each other and isn't referenced in any of their dialogues.
        - name: Frost is also a childhood friend of Pear, which is referenced in a few of his dialogue.
        - name: Frost is referenced by multiple news shouts about stealing <a href='/bussim/items/spronkbib-popsicle'>Spronkbib Popsicles</a>, rendering the popsicles a rarity now. This is alluded to the fact that the chances of getting one from an Ice Cream Truck is extremely rare.
        - name: If you bought pearcoin in the server without rejoining, you need to rejoin to be able to use it however <a href='/bussim/npcs/pear'>Pear's</a> dialogue will change without rejoin needed.
        - name: If you offered Frost a <a href='/bussim/items/spronkbib-popsicle'>Spronkbib Popsicle</a> instead of the <a href='/bussim/items/ice-cream'>Ice Cream</a> + <a href='/bussim/items/pearcoin'>Pearcoin</a> duo, he will still mention about receiving a Pearcoin from you, despite not possibly even owning one nor showing it to Frost in the first place.
        - name: If you really don't want to spend any Robux, the best way to get Frost's trust is to get the legendary <a href='/bussim/items/spronkbib-popsicle'>Spronkbib Popsicle</a>, which has a 1/800 chance of getting, or by giving him multiple <a href='/bussim/items/ice-cream'>Ice Creams</a>.
          children:
            - name: The latter is still not confirmed yet.

        - name: Frostbite has a unique folder inside called TrustLevels which determines what dialogue he uses to the player depending on the player's trust. It comes with 4 levels, Acquainted (1), Friends (2), Stranger (0), and Intruder (First Introductions)
          children:
            - name: He also has TrustLevels_Airhorn which has all 4 subfolders similar to TrustLevels, but ideally has different dialogue based on your current trust with Frost.

          Pear is both a Knitter and a NPC in the second floor.
          If you interact with him, you can have a conversation of many things, invite a friend to gain rewards,
          or buy two songs for everyone in the server for 80 robux, although he recommends not to after "the incident".
          He is also necessary to obtain one of the badges in Bus Simulator.

        title: Inviting Friends
        description: >-
          One of the new features added within the 2/04/2023 Update, following the 20 Million Update. When you talk to Pear, you can invite your friends to join you, and if you and your invited friend stays within the same server for an hour, you both get 10 Driver Rep & Passenger Rep, and you can invite up to 2 more friends granting 5 Driver Rep for each one, but 10 Passenger Rep for each one too, everyday. You'll also get badges for either being the one invited, or inviting someone.
          <br><br>
          You can also invite someone, and then be invited by the same person afterwards to get 2 out of 3 friends with only 1 friend.
          <br><br>
          At most, you can garner up to 20 Driver Rep & 30 Passenger Rep per day, assuming your friends really like to play Bus Simulator a lot.
          <br><br>
          You can also initiate the rewarding system by being invited by a friend from your website or desktop application, should be in your notifications once your friend invites you to the game.

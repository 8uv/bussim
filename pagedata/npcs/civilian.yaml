          Their appearance is random, as they are based off of player ID's, which means that the NPCs appearance is based off of what the player the script chose is wearing,
          which is commonly the 3.0 Man Default with the Smile face. However, there are also ID's for NobleReigns friends that has a higher, but still rare,
          chance of appearing in the events, which do also include some NPCs from events, like the <a href="/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">GOATed Gas Station</a> event.

          The Civilians don't do much in events, but is still notable in some
          way, mostly in the No Dough event.

        description: >-
          In the Passengers event, three random Civilians will board the bus and take the nearest available seat,
          and will ride the bus for a random amount of time, then will get off the seat, wave for a couple of seconds,
          then jump off. They don't say anything when they're boarding or jumping off, unlike Steven from his event, <a href="/bussim/events/steven-ride">Steven Ride.</a>

          In the No Dough event, the Civilians act more like security, and will kill instantly if you're spotted.
          They will get alerted based off of noise (for more information, refer to its <a href="/bussim/events/no-dough">event</a> page),
          and will go towards the noise if alerted. This is great for clearing out an area, but a risky move getting away from the oncoming crowd of Civilians.

          - If there are no open seats, the Civilians will stand in the back of
          the bus, near the restroom.

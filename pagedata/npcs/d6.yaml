        description: >-
          As of July 20th 2023, 
          D6's design has been changed to one more complex, 
          now having long black hair with what seems to be horns poking out of it, 
          along with a maroon punk jacket, 
          suspenders, 
          and pauldrons. 
          Their face appears to be completely obscured by shadow, 
          with only one of their eyes visible.

          <br><br>

          Before this, 
          D6 had a more simple design, 
          with black arms and legs, 
          yellow, 
          torso, 
          and a white head. 
          He wore White Oni Horns,
          Outrageous Builders Club Hard Hat, 
          a White Kobold snout and frills, 
          white fur, 
          a White Lizard Tail, 
          and the Hexxed symbol on his chest.

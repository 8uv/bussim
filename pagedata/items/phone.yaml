          Phone is one of the first tools in the game. 
          It is one of the first tools you are given when playing the game. 
          It can supposedly be used as a flashlight, or just for roleplays.

          Phone is usually kept during some events like <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a> or <a href="/bussim/events/no-dough">No Dough</a>. 
          Particles or chat bubbles will not appear through the phone due to it being glass.

         The Gas Station Gravity Coil is a tool obtainable by purchasing it for 15 passenger rep during the <a href="/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">Goat Station Event</a> event, 
         or by stealing it.

         Upon equipping, your character's gravity will be reduced by a small amount, 
         less than half as effective as the normal Gravity Coil. 
         It'll also play a flangey sounding gravity coil sound effect, 
         further driving the idea that this is a weaker item than one would expect.

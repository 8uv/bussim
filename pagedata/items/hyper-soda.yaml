         The Hyper Soda is a soda variant that can be obtained at the top of the platform next to the sign in the <a href="/bussim/events/obby">Obby</a> event.

         When used, it will provide a similar speed compared to <a href="/bussim/items/almond-water">Almond Water</a>, 
         but after a few seconds after consumption will massive spike in speed, 
         overpowering many if not, all of the other speed items in the game.

         <br><br>

         However, after around more than 10 seconds, 
         you will lose all of your boosted speed and most of your normal walkspeed, 
         making you slower without the help of other speed-related items. 
         This effect usually resolves after a few minutes or by resetting, 
         but it can be very bothersome to many.

        - name: While it is appealing to have a drastic increase in speed, it's debuff afterwards can make exploration punishing especially in events like <a href="/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">Goat Station</a> or <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a> where it's better off to use speed items in the long-term or with no consequences.

            - name: Items such as <a href="/bussim/items/candied-cane">Candied Cane</a>, <a href="/bussim/items/redblox">Redbloxk</a>, <a href="/bussim/items/mini-bus">Mini-Bus</a>, and <a href="/bussim/items/almond-water">Almond Water</a> are better, albeit rarer and mostly limited alternatives.

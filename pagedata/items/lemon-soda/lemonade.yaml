         Lemonade is a VIP / Admin-Exclusive item in Bus Simulator that acts similarly to Lemon Soda, 
         perhaps being the original Lemon Soda prior to being scrapped. 
         It also has the same functionality, 
         dealing around 20 damage as well as inflicting nausea on your character.

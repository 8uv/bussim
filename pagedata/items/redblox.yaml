          RedBlox is an item in the <a href="/wiki/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">GOATed Gas Station Event</a>, 
          and is a one-time use that makes you walk faster for a few seconds, 
          like the <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/hyper-soda">Hyper Soda</a>.

          This effect however, wears down over time, 
          and unlike the other items on sale in Goated Gas, 
          both this and the <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/goala-cola">Goala Cola</a> aren't purchasable due to them being so cheap.

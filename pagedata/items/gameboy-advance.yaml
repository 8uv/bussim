         The Gameboy Advance is a item that can be found on the first floor of the bus, 
         and it allows you to play 1v1 games with somebody else who also has the item out.

         <br><br>

         If you own the <a href="https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/7313794/Game-Cartridge">Game Cartridge</a> gamepass, (or assuming you found a free cartridge in <a href="/bussim/events/nobles-house">Noble's House</a>) you can host games with other players, 
         with a total of five games you can choose from (full list can be seen <a href="/bussim/others/games">here</a>.) When you start a match with somebody, 
         there will be a Link Cable connected to both of the players' consoles, specifically to the port on top.

      content:
        - name: Tic-Tac-Toe, Connect Four, and Battle Wagons are official ROBLOX items that you can buy, but they're currently broken and non-functional.
        - name: The game's title on the Cartridge is called "Bus Routes", and has a map of bus routes on it.
        - name: This is one of the two Nintendo references in the entire game, other one being the <a href="/bussim/events/cubes">Cubes</a> event.
        - name: The original mesh uploader is unknown.
        - name: There's no link cable length limit between both players when they're in a match, meaning you can still play with somebody at different locations.
        - name: The startup sound when you equip the Gameboy Advance used to be a beta Operating System bootup noise for Codename "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Development_of_Windows_Vista">Longhorn</a>", which later became the Windows Vista. A clearer version can be heard <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nIoQAEBImv8&ab_channel=WindowsExpert">here</a>. Unfortunately, it was removed due to a copyright claim.

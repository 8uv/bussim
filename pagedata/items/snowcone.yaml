          The Snowcone is a permanent healing item obtainable from either the 2019 Christmas event or the 20 Million Visits event. 
          During both of these events, you had a 50/50 chance to get either the Snowcone or the <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/snowglobe">Snowglobe</a>.

        - name: It is currently possible to utilize this item as a form of teleportation, first use the item multiple times then unequip it at the first spot.
        - name: 'Secondly, go to any spot outside of your first spot and drink the <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/cramped-cola">Cramped Cola</a>, and lastly: equip the Snowcone again. This will force you to teleport back to your first spot at any point in the game.'
          children:
            - name: The same applies for <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/candied-cane">Candied Cane</a>, but is much less precise and is capable of flinging you upon teleportation.

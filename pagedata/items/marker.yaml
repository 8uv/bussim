         The Marker is an item that allows you to draw lines almost anywhere in the game, 
         it currently has 3 tools, Export, Draw, and Erase.

         <br><br>

         All of your drawings will also be visible to your friends in Public Servers, 
         and to everyone in Private Servers. 
         And will load for others even if they join after you've drawn something.

         <br><br>

         Do note however that as of now, 
         rejoining will purge all your drawings.

         The export tool allows you to export all of your drawings (dots or art) by clicking the 1st button when holding the Marker. 
         It'll export all of the lines you have made in the game and exports them as a Model & Packages in your desktop / browser inventory. 
         All of which is still subjected via moderation.

         <br><br>

         You'll then be able to import them in Roblox Studio to use them in any kind of project in your Places such as graffiti, art, etc.

          The draw tool is the 2nd button when holding the Marker, 
          when clicked on you'll enter Drawing Mode: 
          where you'll be able to draw lines with different colors almost anywhere in the game.

          <br><br>

          There are 4 free colors to use, being Red, Green, Blue, and Black with Black as default. 
          There's also two other features being Glow in the Dark and Custom Colors, 
          however are both locked by their own respective gamepasses.

          <br><br>

          The <a href="https://www.roblox.com/game-pass/235161212/Glow-In-The-Dark-Marker">Glow in the Dark</a> gamepass is as you'd expect, making it glow regardless of lighting; costing only 50 Robux. 
          Likewise, the Custom Colors gamepass allows you to make any other color aside from the 4 using both a selectable color wheel as well as 6 values 
          (being RGB and HSV) and a brightness slider to use specific colors, only costing 65 Robux.

          <br><br>

          Do note however, that drawing on surfaces that can be deleted will also delete any drawings on it, 
          and some parts occasionally from <a href="/bussim/events">Events</a> are considered Invalid Surfaces.

          The erase tool is the 3rd button when holding the Marker, 
          with two functions: when dragging your mouse with this enabled, 
          it'll remove any lines that the eraser touches in a large range. 
          It also works likewise, anywhere similar to the Draw Tool. 
          The secondary function allows you to delete all drawings made by you specifically by simply clicking the Trash icon that appears during Erase Mode.

        - name: This item used to be added years back when the prop itself was added, however Noble forgot to add its' functionality until someone mentioned it again.
        - name: This is the only item that VR players cannot even pick up normally. This is because the item isn't 100% supported for it yet, but will receive one soon.
        - name: The tooltip changes accordingly based on if you are in a Public / Private server, with Private server removing the "Only visible to friends." as it shows up to everyone in the server regardless of status.

         Appearing as a purple and violet present, the item can be opened with left click.

         <a href="/bussim/items/cola">Cola</a>, 
         <a href="/bussim/items/cold-cola">Cold Cola</a>, 
         <a href="/bussim/items/hot-cola">Hot Cola</a>,

         The box could be a reskin of the "Royal Gift of Kings" hat from 2016/2017. 
         The gift was part of a set of similar items which could be bought for large sums of money to unbox into a limited item after a period of time.

        - name: This item used to only give all but the <a href="/bussim/items/marker">Marker</a> and <a href="/bussim/items/pizza">Pizza</a>, due to the former being released after the box and the latter being an oversight. It was then changed to include both to the box 2 years after release.

         The Avian Potion is a consumable that can only be obtained by admin commands. 
         It's appearance is a large, glowing potion with orange liquid inside. When consumed, 
         it gives the user the ability to mash space to flap once, 
         and gives you tiny air time. 
         The item works best when you mash the jump button or with a macro.

         The Bus Birthday Cake was a limited-edition variant of the <a href="/bussim/items/free-modelled-cake">Free-Modelled Cake</a>, 
         added to celebrate Bus Simulator's 5th Birthday. 
         During the week after its introduction, 
         you'll always start with this item.

         <br><br>

         When consumed, it will heal you a tiny amount of health. However, 
         if paired with  <a href="/bussim/items/cola">Cola</a>, you'll end up teleporting to the <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a>. 
         This will also force you to trip upon entry, unlike the <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a> event, 
         where you simply teleport there.

         <br><br>

         The <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a> itself follows the same principles as if you had entered using its titular event, 
         however with a few changes: you'll keep the Cake and Cola (<a href="/bussim/items/bad-cola">including its other variant</a>), 
         the Cola will have a new tooltip, and Pear will charge 20 <a href="/bussim/others/reputation">Passenger Rep</a> for a guide to the exit, 
         as well as some new dialogue. Both the Cake and Cola are one-time use, however.

          If you manage to escape with the Cake, you'll have around a 30% chance to permanently obtain it, 
          making this cake a useful teleportation tool for gathering the last two items or to simply torment yourself.

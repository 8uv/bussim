          The Snowglobe is an item obtained by joining during either the 2019 Christmas event, 
          or the 20 Million Visits event, which was also situated around Christmas. 
          During both of these events, you had a 50/50 chance to get either the Snowglobe or the <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/snowcone">Snowcone</a>.

          When used, the player shakes the Snowglobe, making blue-white sparkles. 
          It has no other practical use as it cannot heal, distract NPCs, or damage you.

            - name: Alongside that, it isn't taken away in the two events mentioned either. The Backwalls, however, will take it away

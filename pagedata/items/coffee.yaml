           Coffee is a usable item obtained from the pool event that appears next to the edges of the pool. 
            It is used much like a soda; however, it gives no additional effects.

           <br><br>

           It appears to be a Bloxdonald's coffee 
           (as can be told from a large yellow 'B') and bears significant resemblance to its real-world counterpart.

            <br><br>

           Its description states : "Old Good Coffee."

            <br><br>

            The coffee is basically identical to the <a href="/bussim/items/cola">Cola</a>, in speed, duration, 
            and health regeneration only that this is less accessible, 
            being in only one event. You are best just getting the Cola, 
            but you can use coffee for cosmetic purposes.

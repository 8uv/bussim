         The Homemade Coffee is an temporary item from the <a href="/wiki/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">Goat Station</a> event, 
         and recovers more health than the <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/cola">Cola</a> and regular <a href="/wiki/bussim/items/coffee">Coffee</a>. 
         The item is the same as the regular Coffee, 
         but is in a mug instead of a BloxDonalds cup.

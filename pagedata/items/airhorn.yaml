          The Airhorn is an expensive gamepass item in Bus Simulator, 
          costing a huge 275 Robux. 
          When used it produces a loud sound from where the player used it. 
          It also has no cooldown per use.

          <br><br>

          Despite its original use being to annoy players, 
          you can use it in No Dough / Santa's Gone to distract the NPCs, 
          luring them into the origin of sound which makes this useful if a bunch of NPCs are patrolling the exit / destination.

          <br><br>

          You can also use it next to other NPCs to annoy them, 
          but beware, 
          for they may not be kind.

         When used, it will at first seem to sound like a normal rocket launcher from Roblox, 
         but will instead explode the person who holds this item instead, 
         It can't also be used to kill other players if you are standing next to them..

        - name: The tool appears to shoot out a blue rocket in the direction you choose when clicked, but the rocket itself doesn't explode, and ignores collision.

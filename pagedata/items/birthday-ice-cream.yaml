         The Birthday Ice Cream is a large ice cream cone. 
         During the <a href="/bussim/events/birthday">Birthday</a> event, 
         when a random player has been picked in that event, 
         the player will get the Birthday Ice Cream item in their inventory immediately.

         <br><br>

         Surprisingly, this item is also quite good at short burst healing, 
         with it's healing speed surpassing the <a href="/bussim/items/cola">Cola</a>, and <a href="/bussim/items/homemade-coffee">Homemade Coffee</a>, 
         but it lacks the duration, which requires you to constantly use it.

         <br><br>

         You can also try and feed it to <a href="/bussim/npcs/frostbite">Frostbite</a> only for him to reject it because it's too big to consume.

         <br><br>

         As of March 2nd, 2023, the item is very unlikely to obtain currently, as sometimes you just will not receive it, even if you were chosen.

        - name: Despite this event suggesting a random player's birthday, it doesn't raise your chances of getting selected if it's currently your actual birthday.
        - name: The easiest way to get this would either to be in a private server all by yourself (either yours or someone else's) or in a very low populated public server.

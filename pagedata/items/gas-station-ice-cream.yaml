         The Gas Station Ice Cream is a tool obtainable by purchasing it for 8 passenger rep during the <a href="/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">Goat Station Event</a>,
          or by stealing it.

         The item works the same as the Ice Cream tool and other ice creams, 
         except it plays a flangey 'Yummy' sound. 
         It doesn't heal very well either, 
         and <a href="/bussim/items/cola">Cola</a> is preferred over this.

         Hot Cola is an item that can be found on the Second-Story of <a href="/bussim/locations/the-bus">The Bus</a> underneath the <a href="/bussim/items/pizza">Pizza Box</a>. 
         When used, it'll act as any normal Cola; 
         but will instead set you ablaze, 
         with high pitched oof noises being produced and fire coming out of your head as your entire body darkens. 
         After a few seconds after consumption, 
         you'll instantly die.
         
         <br><br>

         This can however be prevented by consuming <a href="/bussim/items/cold-cola">Cold Cola</a> instead, 
         freezing you and preventing you from death. 
         It doesn't prevent the lasting effects however.

        - name: While using this and the <a href="/bussim/items/cold-cola">Cold Cola</a> thereafter can prevent you from dying; doing this conversely doesn't automatically extinguish the Hot Cola's effects.

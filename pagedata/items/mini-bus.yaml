         The Mini-Bus is a miniature vehicle which resembles the bus used in the game. 
         It can only fit 1 player, 
         but drives faster than the bus. 
         The Mini-Bus costs R$125 to obtain.

         The Mini-Bus is a common gamepass, and sometimes people will even start a race with other Mini-Bus Drivers.

          The Mini-Bus has a Navy Blue (RGB 33, 84, 185) color for the default body paint. 
          On the sides of the bus, there are two large windows, 
          followed by vents behind them. At the back of the bus, 
          there are two antennas which tilt when turning, and wobble at speed. 
          The Mini-Bus has headlights up front that are covered by a grill, with a single red accent. 
          People that have the OG Driver <a href="/bussim/others/ranks-tags">rank</a> in-game will get sparkles on their Mini-Bus.

          The previous Mini-Bus design was much simpler, 
          and had a design closer to the older Bus design, 
          with fake windows and a couple of avatars in them.

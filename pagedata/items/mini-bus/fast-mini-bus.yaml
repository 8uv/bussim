         The Fast-Minibus is a VIP / Admin-Exclusive item in Bus Simulator that is a super outdated, 
         but uniquely designed version of the regular Mini-Bus. 
         The Fast Mini-Bus drives faster, 
         but unlike the modern counterpart, 
         it collides with non-collidable parts, 
         and cannot drift.

        - name: 'It is currently possible to utilize this item as a form of teleportation, first use the item multiple times then unequip it at the first spot. Secondly, go to any spot outside of your first spot and drink the <a href="/bussim/items/cramped-cola">Cramped Cola</a>, and lastly: equip the Candied Cane again. This will force you to teleport back to your first spot at any point in the game.'

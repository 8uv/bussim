         This item is simply meant to gate players from getting the Helicopter easily without having to pay, 
         with its tooltip stating that it's glued shut. 
         It also doesn't have any other functionality aside from being purchasable for 100  <a href="/bussim/others/reputation">Passenger Reputation</a>.

         <br><br>

         If you do however pay for it, <a href="/bussim/npcs/disc">Disc</a> will then unstick the pages allowing you to learn how to fly, it also gives you a permanent tool called <a href="/bussim/items/helicopter">Helicopter</a>.

         <br><br>

         The cover reads: "how to FLY FREE 100% WORKING 2O22" along with a Dummy flying.

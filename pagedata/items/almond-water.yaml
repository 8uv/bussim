          Almond Water is a healing item obtainable from random floor spawns in the <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a> event. 
          When used, you will gain a significant boost in speed and healing for a few seconds, 
          being able to outrun <a href="/bussim/npcs/entity">Entities</a> and move much quicker throughout the <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a>, 
          however this item only has 2 uses before it'll disappear from your inventory so use wisely.

          There is however, a 33% (formerly 10%) chance of permanently getting Almond Water by escaping the <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a> while you have it in your inventory. 
          The function of the item will remain the same, 
          and while its only usable twice, you can reset to get it back..

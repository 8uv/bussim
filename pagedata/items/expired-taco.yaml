         The Expired Taco is a gear obtained from the <a href="/bussim/events/time-travel">Time Travel Event</a>, 
         and is obtained at the "fizzy taco stand!!!!!!."

         The taco appears to have a green tint, 
         and deals 75 damage to the player. 
         Much more dangerous than the burger from the <a href="/bussim/events/bloxdonalds">Bloxdonalds Event</a>.

           The Cola is an item that is obtainable at the Second floor, 
           or from the Starter Box if you got that from the 10 Million Visits event. 
           Using it will heal you. The cola is one of the best healing items.

           <br><br>

           It is located inside of a crate, with several other colas. 
           Upon clicking on it, there's a 10% chance you will get the <a href="/bussim/items/bad-cola">Bad Cola</a>.

           <br><br>

           More often than other containers (e.g. the vending machine for <a href="/bussim/items/cold-cola">Cold Cola</a>), 
           the crate may malfunction and not dispense cola. 
           This bug somehow self-fixes when you wait, however.

            Another interaction that the Cola can provide is if paired with the <a href="/bussim/items/bus-birthday-cake">Bus Birthday Cake</a> during Bus Simulator's 5th Birthday. 
            When consumed last, you'll be forcibly teleported to the <a href="/bussim/events/backwalls">Backwalls</a>. 
            With the Cola having a new tooltip, 
            do note however that both the Cola and Cake are one-time uses afterwards.

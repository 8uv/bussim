           The Compass is a tool obtainable by purchasing it for 4 passenger rep during the <a href="/bussim/events/goated-gas-station">Goat Station Event</a>, or by stealing it.

           The tool doesn't seem to do much, as all it does is always point to north, which is probably why its one of the cheapest tools in the gas station.

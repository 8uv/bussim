         The Free-modeled Cake (or known as Birthday Cake) is a consumable item in Bus Simulator, 
         gotten from everyone in the <a href="/bussim/events/birthday">Birthday</a> Event. 
         It has the same model and texture as the classic ROBLOX Cake. 
         It doesn't heal nor reduce your health, and isn't a permanent item.

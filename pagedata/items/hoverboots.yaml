         The Hoverboots is a pair of boots that allows you to fly, 
         similar to the <a href="/bussim/items/helicopter">Helicopter</a> item. 
         It could've been obtained from the 10 Middle Event Wheel. 
         To use the item, simply press the jump button while having it equipped to start flying, 
         and you can click to have a speed boost while flying, 
         which changes your particles to orange. 
         However, the Hoverboots has limited fuel, and will turn off if you reach 0%, 
         making you fall from whatever distance you were flying at. 
         The item recharges when you're on the ground.

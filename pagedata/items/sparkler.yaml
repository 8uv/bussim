          The sparkler is a limited-time item that is only given out from December 30th - Jan 1st, to celebrate new years. 
          The sparkler will make sparkles when equipped, and you can swap through colors by clicking, 
          but it'll turn off in-between colors. The sparkles can be Red, Blue, and Green. 
          The sparkler is just a cosmetic item, and has no affects to the player or gameplay.

          The Sparkler Candle is a VR-Exclusive permanent item that only appears in a VR players inventory, 
          unless if given by an admin via admin commands. 
          The sparkler can also be a light source, emitting a strong light, 
          and also has a trail affect behind the sparkles. 
          Just like the Sparkler, it is just a cosmetic item.

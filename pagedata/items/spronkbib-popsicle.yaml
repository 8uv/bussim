         The Spronkbib Popsicle is obtainable along with <a href="https://www.roblox.com/badges/2124830393/The-Last-One">The Last One</a> badge as a 1/800 (formerly 1/1000) chance from the naturally spawning ice cream vans. 
         Once you do get it though, 
         you won't be able to get another normal <a href="/bussim/items/ice-cream">ice cream</a> without having to delete the Last One badge. <small>(But why would you?)</small>

         <br><br>

         When held it plays the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ncgv7ruZ6HU&ab_channel=PrincessAmber">Steel String</a> sound effect from Spongebob Squarepants and upon licking it, 
         the player will receive rapid health regeneration for a short time.

         <br><br>

         It is currently obtainable in a VIP server.

        - name: The popsicle itself is based off of the real-life version of the Spongebob popsicles.
        - name: The Spronkbib Popsicle used to be a temporary item, which was changed in the 20 Million Visits update.
        - name: While it may not seem like much, the Spronkbib Popsicle isn't removed from the Backwalls, Santa's Gone, and No Dough, making it a slightly overpowered item in said events.
          children:
            - name: In Backwalls you can use this to heal rapidly from dark goo puddles.
            - name: In No Dough and Santa's Gone, it works as a good distraction without the <a href="/bussim/items/airhorn">Airhorn</a>.
        - name: You need to enable <a href="/bussim/others/vehicles">Vehicles</a> within the Performance Settings for the Ice Cream Truck (as well as other vehicles) to spawn.

          The Pizza is an item obtainable from a pizza box in the second floor of the bus. 
          Eating it will heal you. 
          Equipping the pizza will play a sound effect saying 'Pizza Time', 
          a reference to the movie 'Spider-Man 2'.

          Additionally, on the same floor, you can spot another pizza in the left compartment, 
          next to the one by the <a href="/bussim/items/cramped-cola">Cramped Cola</a>. However, it cannot be interacted with.

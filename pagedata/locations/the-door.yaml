         The Door is an entrance point that is always a considerable distance behind the bus, 
         sitting next to a few wooden planks. 
         You can get to the door by using <a href="/bussim/items/hoverboots">Hoverboots</a> or <a href="/bussim/items/helicopter">Helicopter</a> (the latter requires a speed boost from an item such as <a href="/bussim/items/almond-water">Almond Water</a> to cover the distance) while timing your descent just right to trigger the door, 
         or by waiting until the Bus is stopped by an event, 
         and travelling over to it.

          Entering the door leads to an area filled with bright yellow grass, 
          two faceless noobs, 
          a stone statue, 
          and a big sun with a default face on it. 
          The background is a neon pink, 
          and can be seen from the bus if you have your Graphics Quality set to a high amount, 
          and you look backwards to the left. 
          In some cases, 
          interacting with one of the faceless noobs will cause them to slap you, 
          sending you backwards a bit. 
          You can use the same alternate methods you may have used to come here (Hoverboots, Helicopter) to fly up the stone borders and stand on top of the sun. 
          You can also use <a href="/bussim/items/mini-bus">Mini-Bus</a> to clip up the borders if you use it on the edge of a corner. 
          However, 
          you won't be able to get above the sun if you don't have any means of flying.

        - name: This is one of, if not the only non-event area in the game to not feature any NPCs that can start a discussion.
        - name: If you're lucky (or unlucky), you can use Mini-Bus to clip outside the pink background, revealing the outsides of the area.
          children:
            - name: There are small stone crevices that you can stand on outside the area, but you may be eventually pushed by an area transition wall into the ocean.

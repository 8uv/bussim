          This is also where everyone hangs out for most if not almost all of their entire time playing this game, with parts of it from <a href="/bussim/events">Events</a>.
          It also serves as an effective shelter for events that can kill players if outside, like <a href="/bussim/events/blizzard">Blizzard</a>, <a href="/bussim/events/acid-rain">Acid Rain</a>, <a href="/bussim/events/flash-flood">Flash Flood</a>, etc.

            There are also extra texts coming from NobleReign, mostly from his very first fanart he received.

                The first art on the left is the very first and original fanart, and it says: <highlight type="grey">"this IS my first ever fanart by Dysphorian (now tal1y) they brought it back from the dead :)"</highlight><br><br>

                The art on the right side shows the more updated version of the left one, and it says: <highlight type="grey">"they also made this one, its like a revamped version :D"</highlight><br><br>

                There's also some text that is shown above the Emergency Button that sends you back to <a href="/bussim/locations/the-bus">The Bus</a>, due to VR players unable to trip on the puddle.

                    It also had an advertisement of the VRChat version of Bus Simulator: <highlight type="grey">"vr players check out the vrchat version of bus sim"</highlight>

                        It was later removed because of possibly breaking Roblox's TOS, leading the user offsite. It was now replaced by this instead: <highlight type="grey">"vr players hit this instead"</highlight>

            In one of the past builds of Bus Simulator, the Art Gallery also had a larger text above the ceiling in red saying <text style="color: red;">"make efeuc fanart"</text>. But it was later removed in an Unknown Build.

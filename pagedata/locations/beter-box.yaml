         The Beter Box is a small box located infront of the <a href="bussim/locations/the-bus">Bus</a> outside. 
         The box itself is rather small, 
         and has multiple moving images of Peter Griffin, 
         as well as one in the center, 
         which will always look at you. 
         The box cannot be seen that well on the outside, 
         unless if you get close to it, 
         which the outside of it is vaguely visible. 
         The Beter Box is difficult to enter without the use of Transportation items, 
         such as <a href="bussim/items/hoverboots">Hoverboots</a> or <a href="bussim/items/helicopter">Helicopter</a>, 
         but still possible to do, 
         if you do it right, 
         as there is a small ledge you can jump onto, 
         which will help you get in. If you succeed, 
         you will recieve a badge for entering the box for the first time.

        - name: The Beter Box used to be a simple transparent wall that had an image of Peter Griffin facing the opposite way, and was much easier to get on.
        - name: The reason why the Beter box is harder to see on the outside is because it has a transparent layer of Glass infront of the box, which won't show Decals on the inside.

        - name: There is actually another Beter Box in the game, but is impossible to reach normally, and you would need to do a specific glitch and be lucky, or go to coords X 44.803, Y 100011.203 Z -56.535 via <a href="bussim/items/edit">Edit</a>/F3X after highlighting yourself via Explorer.
